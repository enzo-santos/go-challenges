## Description

Here's a little puzzle I made today:

```none
sqrt(ILLUMINATE) = LIGHT
```

Most usual rules of alphametic puzzles apply here: the same letter always represents the
same digit, and numbers don't start with *0*s. However, here it is possible for two
different lettters to represent the same digit.
