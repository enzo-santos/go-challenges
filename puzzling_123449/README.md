## Description

I started off with a one-letter English language word. For every step, I added one
letter of my choice, and re-arranged the letters to make a new word. By the end, I
had:

>  EMPATHISE

What was the word I started with, and how did I get to the word that I ended with?

My solution is probably not unique, so will be interesting to see if there are other
paths.
